[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is "a free and open source distributed version control system".

This means that it is:
1. *free*: does not cost money to use
2. *open source*: source code accessible & developed by the public
3. *distributed*: hosted by mulitple machines
4. *version control system*: a system to manage different versions of a single repositories

Therefore, `git` keeps a record of all changes made to a project such that you can always refer back to a specific version when needed. The *distributed* aspect of `git` allows for multiple contributors to work at the same time.
